# Ingress Triage System Prompt  (placeholder — will be replaced after hello-world proves the round trip)
#
# This file will contain the full system instructions for the INGRESS_ANALYZE_HTTP
# Prompt action in Copilot Studio / Power Automate.
#
# Requirements (from spec):
#   - JSON only. No prose. No fences.
#   - Must follow schema shapes v1_1 for norm/tac/sig.
#   - Must create NORM segments with seq starting at 1.
#   - TAC inputs.norm_ref = norm(source):<norm_id>
#   - SIG inputs.norm_ref = norm(source):<norm_id>
#   - All evidence_refs use norm_id + #seq or #start-end
#   - recommended_nudges max 1-3
#   - Leave arrays empty when weak evidence

TODO: Replace this placeholder with the full production prompt after hello-world succeeds.
